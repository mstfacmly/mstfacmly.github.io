alHamdul'illah comes in waves
like grief
    and joy
     and     hope
and     despair

it washes over and returns to the sea
it laps at the ankles
like Mother's hands preparing prayer

we put out wishes on paper boats 
    and leave them to the ocean
in the hopes that some one
    some    where
answers

   in the end
what more is there
            save

alHamdul'illah comes in waves
