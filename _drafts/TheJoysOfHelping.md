## Or: My problems with Man of Steel's approach to Superman, and how Justice League partially fixed them

![On my world, it means Superman](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/35/Supermanflying.png)

I truly, deeply wanted to love Henry Cavill as Superman. I went to see Immortals just so I could have a look at the then-recently announced Man of Steel movie. In it, I found a young man, with some charm, playing a powerful demigod who will inspire others to be better and rise against an oppressor. The movie wasn't exactly great, but it had style, and it gave me a peek at the upcoming Superman. 

When Man of Steel came out, I went to see it with my children, then aged 8 and 4. I was expecting a high-action, visually spectacular show that would end in an inspiring display of hope and, maybe, joy. I was not prepared for the chaos that ensued. While walking out of the theater, many thoughts ran through my mind. In my then-naiveté, I considered that yes, this was an interesting take on the Superman story. That maybe this approach is a sort of reverse-Richard Donner's Superman films--That this first movie was about him [failing and learning from his failures](https://www.starwars.com/news/teaching-with-star-wars-learning-from-failure-in-star-wars-the-last-jedi) against a powerful enemy, and that the next movie would be about Clark learning from his prior experience and becoming the symbol of hope, truth, and justice--One who takes enjoyment from helping others, without asking for anything in return. I liked that possibility. My main worry at the time, was that the middling response would mean that WB would panic and insert Batman into the story, since Batman was a sure money maker for them, as was demonstrated by the Dark Knight Trilogy and the Burton films (and Arkham video games).

Then came [San Diego Comic Con 2013](BvS announcement). But I'm getting ahead of myself.

## A Preface

Before going further I need to mention that I personally don't have a problem with the idea of Superman killing. The "no kill" rule was basically an addition of Mccarthyism, in which the U.S. government was blaming entertainment to be the cause of all sorts of so-called "anti-American" thought -- which includes Communism, homosexuality, and threatening to throw people in positions of authority who abuse their powers out of a window -- that these policies were put in place after the mid-late-1940s saw the collapse of the KKK -- In which Superman had an indirect hand via the radio play -- should also be telling about what the government of the time considered to be "anti-American".

From the earliest storties, Superman was written in a style similar to the pulp adventure heroes of the time -- notably the Barsoom series -- which often ended with the villain du jour perishing at the hands of their own folly, or as a result of the protagonist letting them perish. This eventually was cleared out in favor of the no kill rule, and later tellings found a fairly universal explanation as to why a demigod would choose to not take a life.

I'm mentioning this now in the preface in order to preemptively avoid responses of the "you just don't get it" type, as I elaborate on why the Zod neck snap didn't land in Man of Steel later in the essay.

## The Superman

We also need to take a small detour at discussing the Nietzschean concept of the Superman, and how Shuster and Siegel managed to demonstrate both the [misunderstood and correct interpretations of Nietzsche's Ubermench](https://youtu.be/ti9zdpLlXf0).

As Superman aficionados are wont to know, the original pitch for a "Superman" story was that of an evil being bent on ruling the world with his superior intellect and senses as a result of a science experiment gone wrong. A few months after that initial story, Jerry Siegel realized the concept of Superman would make for a better character for a comic strip. It would take another five years before the character made his appearance in Action Comics #1. The rest, as they say, is history.

What's interesting is that both interpretations match Nietzean understandings of "the superman". Whether intentional or not, the [Reign of the Superman](https://ohdannyboy.blogspot.com/2012/06/1933s-reign-of-superman-first-superman.html) tale resembles the popular misunderstanding of the superman: Might makes right, and the weak follow the strong. A continuation of absolute power corrupting absolutely, and that your strengths *entitle* you to ruling over others. It didn't pan out, obviously, and with good reason. The 1930s was the decade of a global depression--one that lead to rise of Facism in Italy and Nazism in Germany. The world wasn't in need of another evil in the popular conscience.

It then becomes significant that Shuster and Siegel managed to create a more accurate interpretation of Nietzsche's ideal man. One whose true strength came from his morality, which he could then apply thanks to being "a physical marvel". Indeed, Nietzsche's Ubermench was that of someone willing to question societal norms and forge his own moral path. One where his virtue isn't based on the idea that your social status makes you better than others. One where doing the right thing is a higher moral imperative than doing what you need to advance in society's conceptions of successful living. He was, in other words, the exact opposite of Objectivist philosophy.

But this understanding means that, by default, the "superman" isn't an all-knowing God, or a superior being by virtue of being more powerful. A superman is one who tries to do the best thing they can do, and learn from when they don't. A superman doesn't give up, not out of stubbornness, but out of an unfaltering desire to grow and be better.

The idea of Superman not having all of the answers is simply fantastic. There's something innately human(e) in trying to be and do better. That Superman isn't an adult in a room full of children, or humanity's dad, or a god, but is rather unburdened by most of our fears. That his absolute powers absolved him of worry and want. Scott Snyder understood and demonstrated this in Superman Unchained -- perhaps ironically delivered by Lex Luthor, of all people.

## Man of Steel

While this isn't a piece specifically about about some of the film's glaring issues, I will give it some of them a brief mention:
* David Goyer's need to explain a terraforming three times to the audience (once in the Jor El exposition scene, once in the dead earth vision conversation between Zod and Kal, and once by the military), just in case they forgot what the plot of the movie was
* The dialogue in this movie reads as trite and generic ("There's only one way this can end, Kal. Either I kill you, or you kill me." followed by "You're a monster Zod"), while simultaneously pretending to be grandiose
* The movie basically degenerates into a near-continuous slug fest from the moment Clark puts on the suit
* But mainly after having a chat with a priest about how he must be sacrificed to save humanity before humanity could even care about his existence
* The lack of touching on the rebuilding of Metropolis
* Clark and Lois' relationship in spite of a lack of a chemistry or set up or build up
* How Clark has a job at the Daily Planet in spite of no (presented) past writing
* Clark's unwillingness to do his job as busboy and somewhat bouncer and throw out a trucker harassing a waitress, and instead choosing to jam a bunch of logs into the trucker's vehicle
* How Zod and the other Kryptonians wanted to terraform Earth rather than...any of the other nearby planets, or how Kal doesn't even bring up that possibility instead of sheepishly pleading "No! Zod! I can't take part of this! Zod! ZOOOD!"

A number of the above problems could be levied at other Superman movies, but they won't because those other films weren't presenting themselves as "more realistic, gritty, adult" versions of Superman.

## In which Clark has no agency

It may be tired to do so, but in order to address how Man of Steel failed Clark and, by extension of it, the message of "hope" it plays lip service to, I will have to compare it with the 1978 Superman movie. This is in large part because a lot of my nagging issues with Man of Steel were made blindingly clear after I had put on Superman: the Movie right after having watched Man of Steel.

Others have pointed out how Clark has no agency in Man of Steel. Both his fathers had their (contradictory) designs for him: Jonathan Kent wanted him to keep his powers under wraps until they could understand what his purpose on earth was (even though Clark's first instincts clearly indicate he wants to help)--A plan that was cut short by Jonathan's choice of committing suicide by tornado because of his belief that Clark was not ready. Jor-El, on the other hand wanted his son to lead humanity as a much more blatantly Christ-like figure than previous depictions save maybe Superman Returns.

Contrast this with Superman: the Movie, in which Jonathan also didn't have all of the answers, didn't quite know what Clark's raison d'etre was, but who definitely believed he had a greater purpose than throwing footballs. A purpose which he found, many years later, but which Jonahtan couldn't have seen due to a heart failure. Jor El's plans for Kal El still included some messianic allusions, but he would take the time to remind him that, like Kryptonians, humans are good in spite of what failings they may have, and that he shouldn't resent them when they fail, but rather show them compassion, as he could be "light to guide them the way". He spent 12 years teaching his son as much as he could about his culture, and taught him to better understand his abilities. He did, however, have one rule: It is forbidden to interfere in human history. Helping people was still Clark's choice, and he has power over the decision to put on that suit for the first time and help out. The extended cut even has a scene where he discusses the feeling of elation after helping, and Jor El explaining that it's best that he does not do this full time, as to not make them dependent on him.

In both cases, Clark ends up defying his fathers in order to choose his own path. In Man of Steel, it's the neck snap moment. In Superman, it was the time travel sequence. If we only look at these scenes outside of their movies' contexts, the Man of Steel action might appear to be the more grounded and believable choice. But we're not going to do that, because this would be a dishonest narrative. That said, here's the context:

In the scene leading to Clark travelling back in time to prevent the death of Lois, he had been frantically flying within and around the west coast, trying to minimize the damage caused by Lex's mad plan of making Bill Hicks' Arizona Bay skit a reality. Inevitably, he succeeded: He was able to use his powers to help everyone. He had saved he day. Or so he thought. His celebration was cut short when he realized, too late, that there was one person he didn't save: Lois, echoing his sentiment at his father's funeral ("All of these things I can do...and I couldn't even save him"). Much has been said about Christopher Reeve's charm as being the "only" driving force behind his Superman movies, completely ignoring the acting talent displayed at a young age. The transition of feelings, going from despair, to grief, to potent rage as he defies Jor El's missive, and travels back in time at just the right moment to avert the second missile from causing much damage, and, ultimately, saving everyone. (Special note should be given to the decision to let the moment linger on in silence, and not fill the air with dramatic music). This one-time act of time travel (originally intended for the sequel) is, in essence, the [world made of cardboard speech](https://youtu.be/4GDNd8b_QOo) applied not to punching something, but to saving everyone.

In Man of Steel, on the other hand, Clark had just spent the past 20 odd-minutes punching it out with a suicidally violent Zod through the increasingly spreading rubbles of Metropolis. A suicidally violent Zod whose anger, it bears mentioning, was caused by Clark's decision to essentially commit genocide on the last of the unborn Kryptonians. While his choice was arguably not a bad thing--Krypton had effectively eugenicized itself to death--as it was ,in essence, meant to symbolize Clark's choice of Earth as his home--his world, so to speak. Metropolis lied in ashes because it was decided that the best way to stop the terraforming machines was for him to go all the way across the world to the Indian ocean and destroy the machine over there, rather than the mirror machine set up in Metropolis. All of the choices made by him and the army had been idiotic at best, and careless at worst. So, while the choice of snapping Zod's neck was a shocking moment to witness (imagine seeing that as a child), his decision to do so because a random family (yes, I'm going for the random family argument) does not hold up because of the preceding destruction. He had no hesitation at punching Zod through buildings, so why the sudden fear for the safety of a family when, as was re-demonstrated by Batman v Superman's intro, he had pretty much contributed to the leveling of half the city. That his participation in the destruction was unintentional does not, in any way, make it better. When your punches can destroy hard steel, *impact* far outweighs *intent*.

Another example of how the Superman of each film demonstrated their dedication to the preservcation of all life with the same set of scenes: 
* In Superman, when Clark is laying Lois' dead body on the ground, he lets out a momentary gasp as he feared injuring her. She was dead, and he still put in the effort of treating her as if she could get hurt.
* In Man of Steel, as the battle with Zod rages on, Zod shoves a Lexcorp fuel truck at Kal, which he immediately chooses to...hover over as if it was an annoyance.

In fact, the latter example bears a striking resemblance to the more similar Superman II scene in which Zod launches a bus full of people, in spite of Clark's pleading, and where Clark takes the full blow of the bus in order to avert the passengers' death.

Stepping away from the Donner film(s) as examples, let's go for the comics.
* **Superman: Birthright:** Clark fights a desperate battle in Metropolis against a false invading Kryptonian army while Luthor is projecting kryptonite radiation in the city's atmosphere, all while having to show the people of Metropolis that he's on their side, and taking hits from the people he's trying to protect. It's ultimately his perseverance that wins the crowd over, especially after his saves a child in the most "I am here to help" display possible.
* **The New 52 Action Comics** run, his first story had him face Brainiac, who had shrunk Metropolis and was proceeding with destroying the planet. He was also (again) fighting a public that was being turned against him by Lex Luthor, who was using the "he's an invader" dogwhistle. The battle ends with Clark not only saving the day, but also restoring the city, and inheriting Brainiac's ship. He also gives a small speech to the city, telling them that he's there for them.
* **Man and Superman**, Clark has a mastery of his powers, but doesn't quite have the whole superhero thing down pat. He makes multiple mistakes that make the public distrust him, even when he is saving them. This makes Clark doubt in his potential to do good, until Lois' belief in him, and her willingness to speak truth to power, convinces him that not only is there good that can be done, but that he woudn't be alone in the struggle.
* **Superman: Earth One** sees a young, brilliant, but lost Clark Kent try to find his place in the world. He has no knowledge of Krypton or his past beyond being adopted and not exactly human. An alien invasion forces him to reveal his existence to the world, prompting people to ask if his presence caused the invasion, some of which wanting him to "go home", while others are simply thankful he was there to stop the invasion and potential destruction of the planet.

These and many others have approached and addressed the notion of a "modern" take on Superman. Time and time again, similar questions have been raised. Time and time again, the answers lead to Superman as a protector of the people, whether public opinion favours him or not. With the exception of Earth One, Clark's choice to reveal himself comes of his own volition. Concordantly, in not having had the choice to reveal himself, the Earth One Superman does not position himself as a defacto symbol of hope, just because the S on his chest means that on his world. It does, however, show him as just another kid trying his best to do good.

The Snyder Superman then becomes an empty shell of a being. Someone whose actions oppose his words, which then informs his silences. His entire persona and personality is defined by the [Informed Attribute trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute), in which the viewer is told, rather than shown, what he stands for. He says his S is a symbole of Hope, but none of his actions *inspire* hope. They inspire effort, they inspire determination, sure. But hope? In what way? Heck, in BvS, he flat out says "Superman was never real" after Lois tells him that his symbol means something. How can one inspire hope if you do not even believe in it?

Side note: Why is it that whenever there are attempts to "modernise" the Man of Tomorrow, the first instincts are to give him a suit whose design closely resembles that of Ultraman, and whose colours are those of the corrupted Superman from Superman III?

## A tale of Four Fathers (and a Martha)

Let's step it back a minute into the Jonathan Kent and Jor El of each film.

Regarding the "maybe" scene: I fully get the intention. Jonathan doesn't know how to deal with keeping Clark's abilities a secret and is, himself, testing how far he thinks Clark should be willing to go to protect that information. This exchange and the one with Clark in the basement are some of the most touching moments between them, especially his response to Clark's fear of "You **are** my son" (a lovely reversal of a similar situation in Birthright, if I might add). The problem stems from the knowledge that Jonathan had brought a piece of the ship Clark landed in to a metallurgist. It's not simply that he's setting a double standard with regards to the secret, but moreso the implication that no one, not a single government agency attempted showing up at the Kent farm in the years since, essentially disproving his fears for at least a decade by that point.

Defenders of the movie tend to disregard prior portrayals of Jonathan Kent as a "perfect" father, but even with the limited time we spent with him in the 1978 movie, we know he shared the same fears:
> "When you first came to us, we thought that people would come and take you away because--when they found out, you know, the things you could do--...it worried us a lot."

This idea of Jonathan Kent fearing for Clark's--his son's--safety, is nothing new. The worry about his abilities is nothing new. In fact, way back in Superman #1 (published in 1939), Jonathan Kent was telling young Clark to restrain his powers because others would be afraid of them. However, by the time we meet Clark in his late teens, Jonathan came to understand that his fears were ultimately unfounded "But then a man gets older and he thinks very differently--things get very clear." In his last moments together Jonathan tells his son "I know you're going to do great things with your abilities, but that goes beyond what I can teach you."

The last time we see Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel, Clark was about the same age as when we first meet him in the 1978 movie. The are fighting over Clark's abilities, which Jonathan has had at least 15 years to get used to. It ends with Clark telling him he is not his dad, which would end up being his last words to him before Jonathan commits suicide by tornado. Snyder fans will point that this was Jonathan's way of telling Clark how far he would go to hide his secret. But in truth, all it did was mess up Clark for life; That his father would have preferred to die, rather than let Clark save him is messed up. This scene could have worked differently had Clark chosen to disobey his father and save his life. Maybe it would have set Clark to go on the run, because his father's paranoia got to him, prompting a series of instances where he saves people and keeps running in a manner similar to the Hulk TV series. Or maybe they would have stayed at the farm, fearing the worst, and realizing that even after that, no one came for him, and his father's fears were disproven. Or maybe he could have tried to save him, but still failed, leading him to feel that his limitless powers might not be enough to save those he cares about. But that's just conjecture, which deviates from the point.

The point being: Jonathan Kent has always been portrayed as someone who doesn't have all of the answers, but will do his best to be the right kind of father he thinks a super powered alien infant would need. The difference is that this time, Snyder and Goyer chose to go for the "scars his child for life" kind of father, putting him in a similar seat as the MCU Thanos, where the ends justify the means, or the real world shit dads who would rather put down their child or discourage them from living fully in the name of some unknowable fear.

Then comes Jor El, and his designs in both films. In Superman, he mostly wants his son to live, and for him to carry the legacy of Krypton by his mere existence. The Krypton of his movie was presented as an advanced and mainly benevolent society, and he hoped that teaching Kal El about his heritage would lead to him becoming an inspiration for humanity to aspire at a similar greatness, minus the vanity that caused Krypton's high council to ignore Jor El's warnings--leading them to their doom. In Man of Steel, Jor El says he wants Kal to choose his own destiny--what with him being Krypton's first natural birth in centuries--but he **really** wants him to lead humanity towards greatness. Nowhere does he make it more obvious than when he tells his son "You can save them, Kal. You can save all of them", right before Kal T-poses into outer space.

Which brings us to Martha. Martha, Martha Martha. I say that name multiple times because what a disappointment she's become in the films. 

In Man of Steel, she seemed to be the level-headed Martha Kent of the comics, who acts as a counter balance to Jonathan's worries, and raises her son to be his own man. The flashback sequence in which she helps ground Clark while his sensory powers are first manifesting is genuinely gripping stuff. In that scene, she's shown as his emotional anchor in a world that can easily become too big, teaching him an invaluable lesson: You can't fix everything, but you can fix what's right in frontof you. Later on in the film, after Kal, Zod, and the military total Smallville, she brushes off any worries about a broken house as "just stuff", implying that she's wise enough to know that things can be replaced, but people and memories are what's truly valuable.

But in Batman v Superman, she basically demonstrated that she believes the exact same things as Jonathan. Once more from Superman #1: immediately after Jonathan tells young Clark to keep his powers hidden, Martha chimes in with a "but you should be ready to use them to help others when you've matured". Not this Martha. No siree bob. This Martha is ready to sacrifice the children, if need be, because Clark doesn't owe this world a damned thing.

You know, other than unwittingly attracting Zod by activating a spaceship and immediately abandonning it, and then contributing to the decimation of at least half of Metropolis' population.

But hey, he's a guy from *Kansas*.

## Immigrant Song

Man of Steel and, by extension, Batman v Superman, depict the idea of [immigrants preserving their culture as inherently evil.](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2013/06/27/identity-crisis) Zod couldn't just want to keep Krypton alive, he had to do it on a foundation of corpses, in essence feeding the notion that immigrants who don't integrate have only one goal: To take over those who were already there. Those films did it so loudly that it basically started the ["Superman is an immigrant"](https://wearetheamericanway.tumblr.com/) movement in response. I'd *want* to give Snyder the benefit of the doubt and say that he held up a mirror to the US's colonialist past, but that's giving too much credit to a man who just [**really, really** likes squares.](https://www.polygon.com/movies/22336749/justice-league-4-3-square-box-look-on-tv)

And give too much credit is exactly what [This essay on Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/exq3qj/batman-v-superman-is-actually-a-good-depiction-of-the-american-muslim-experience) does in postulating the idea that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is about the Muslim experience in the U.S., something Snyder himself agrees with, as it allows him to defer any effort in his work to his fans, rather than through his work. The argument of Superman as an immigrant's allegory is interesting and could work if we ignore that Zack Snyder had previously directed 300, a movie where the (then not Muslim, as if that makes a difference anyway) Iranian army is portrayed as faceless invaders, literal monsters, or just disturbing due to overt queerness, one that historians have called ["Racist and insulting"](https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/37394). A movie that was [shown to the military](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/15/junior-officers-reading-club) in order to get them pumped up to kill some "ay-raabs". Then there's the incidental choice of juxtaposing a shot of Muslims praying in a mosque, with a shot of the zombie plague spreading. Whether intentionally done or not isn't the point. The point is that his actions, just like his Superman, contradict his words. The idea of this Superman representing Muslims is very much akin to having the planes that struck the twin towers be a representation of Muslims.

## Style killing Substance Killing Style Killing Hope

There's this idea in internet circles that the Snyder Superman may not be the one we need, but he is the one we "deserve". I would like to believe they were echoing this [BvS Review](https://www.filmfreakcentral.net/ffc/2016/03/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice.html), where the argument is that the U.S., having entered the Post-9/11 world, had essentially entered its teen years and was in its edgelord phase--but this mindset is really just a tired rehash of the Dark Knight's ending without understanding what it meant.

As if Superman (1978) was released in a time of peace and prosperity, and not in a decade that saw the economy almost collapse, where there was a fear of fuel shortage. A decade were the U.S. had come out of the Vietnam war, and whose returning veterans were not only dealing with PTSD, but were also abandonned by their own goverment after participating in a war they wanted no part in. The same decade that gave the world the Nixon administration and the Watergate scandal. By that standard, the 1978 Superman movie should have been "dark and realistic". Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz instead made the smarter decision of having Superman fight not an invading alien army, or an evil supercomputer, but instead fight a less tangible enemy: Cynicism. Heck, Action Comics #1 came out in 1938, while the Nazis had risen to power in Germany, and Jewish, Romani, Black, gay, disabled and elderly Europeans were fleeing the rising threat of a loud fascist fueling the fires of hatred. Literal fascism was in power in Italy. The Spanish Civil War was raging on for for two years. When Man of Steel had come out, the so-called "War on Terror" had been ragin on for over a decade. The U.S. economy was recovering from eight years of the Bush Jr administration. Not a year earlier, inspired by the Arab spring revolutions, the Occupy movment was the topic of the times.

If Zack Snyder wanted it, he could have chosen to make a Superman movie that was meant to inspire hope, rather than simply play lip service to it. Instead, we got a cynical take on the world. A world where, I should remind, [Batman could get raped in prison](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/zack-snyder-old-interview-batman-prison-rape-2016-5). Snyder's cinematic world is an angry, ugly, cynical, and unaware perception that will not put any effort towards building a better world, let alone conceptualize that such a world can exist. And he was given the reigns over Superman. In what world can we justify a Superman whose ideology matches and confirms that of Manchester Black? Don't take my word on it, [the man himself](https://www.vox.com/2019/3/26/18282194/zack-snyder-batman-kills) basically quoted Black's ideology verbatim:

> “It’s a cool point of view to be like, ‘My heroes are still innocent. My heroes didn’t fucking lie to America. My heroes didn’t embezzle money from their corporations. My heroes didn’t commit any atrocities.’ That’s cool. But you’re living in a fucking dream world”

I wonder what Superman's response to this would be. On, right:

> Dreams save us. Dreams lift us up and transform us. And on my soul, I swear... until my dream of a world where dignity, honor and justice becomes the reality we all share — I'll never stop fighting. Ever.

For those not in the know, that's from Action Comics #775 (later adapted into Superman vs the Elite). It's telling that Zack Snyder's Superman is one where he can tell Lois Lane that "Superman was never real" shortly before entering a punchout with Batman and choosing a pointless death against a cave troll.

> "You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time! But you were wrong." 
#### Harvey "Two-Face" Dent, shortly before deciding if he wants to shoot Jim Gordon's son, and basically stating out loud the ideals behind Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.

Even stylistically, Snyder chose a colour grading similar to that of the first Matrix film. A gradient that [Bill Pope and John Gaeta chose to kill any feeling hopefulness in the film, and make the audience feel uneasy](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/129322). Even the real-world "blue" gradient was intensified in order to preserve the idea of a colder world, in which humanity had some, but very little, hope of surviving the war with the machines. The colours in the Matrix films were so effective, that the first time we see an actual blue sky in both the real world and within the Matrix itself, there's an elation, a feeling that this could be the dawn of a new era. Maybe Snyder chose that gradient with intent, or maybe he did because he thought it looked cool and more grounded. The former would further confirm that all that talk and posturing about how "it means Hope" was just that: talk and posturing. The latter basically states that Zack Snyder, for all of his pretense of being an auteur, is only one slow motion walk away from Michael Bay.

## notes for later:
Zack Snyder -- [Batman drops the f-bomb](https://ew.com/movies/zack-snyders-justice-league-theaters-r-rated/) - his need to insert rapes (300), or sexualizing a rape (Watchmen).
With a single quote from Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns, Zack Snyder told the world that eiter upper management had indeed panicked, and elected to insert Batman into the follow-up film, or that he [didn't have any idea what to do next](https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Batman-V-Superman-Co-Writer-Once-Dismissed-Idea-Was-He-Right-121707.html). According to Snyder, this was the plan all along.
